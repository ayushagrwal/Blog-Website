# Blog-Website

In this website we can compose blogs which will be shown on the Home page after completion. I've used NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, EJS templating, and Lodash to create this web application. NodeJS provided the ability to run JavaScript on the server-side, which was essential for building the backend of the website and ExpressJS helped in web framework to handle routing and middleware, making it easy to set up the various endpoints for the website. Bootstrap was used for the frontend design, providing a clean and responsive layout that worked well on all devices. EJS templating allowed me to create dynamic HTML pages that could be easily updated with new data from the backend. Finally, I utilized Lodash for some utility functions to create a more efficient and user-friendly website. Overall, this technology stack enabled me to build a powerful and feature-rich blog writing platform that met the project requirements.
